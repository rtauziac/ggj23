They are the only one who can produce ginger tea. Wait, they are really the only one here! Their name is Rootbot.

At a time where humanity no longer exists, this little robot will do whatever it takes to prepare their tea, for this is their only moment of happiness left.

Take care of the ginger roots to make them bigger, add water to the soil, avoid spilling it and watch the ginger grow; at the end of the day, you'll be able to brew your own fine beverage.
